# NAME

dfm - a utility to manage dotfiles

# SYNOPSIS

dfm is a small utility that manages dotfiles.  It:

- makes it easy to install (and uninstall) your dotfiles on new servers
- easy fetching and merging changes that were pushed from other machines
- simplifies working with your dotfiles repository, no matter where your current directory is

# DESCRIPTION

dfm works best when it's included in your dotfiles repository.  If you don't
have a dotfiles repository already, you can use
[this starter repository](https://github.com/justone/dotfiles).

# SEE ALSO

For more information, check out the [wiki](http://github.com/justone/dotfiles/wiki).

You can also run `dfm --help`.
